Game Idea: Players will get the chance to play through 2 game modes Scuba Diver and Estuary Expedition

Scuba Diver: In this game mode the player will control a scuba diver and will try to take pictures of as many unique animals in the estuary as they can before time runs out. Whenever a picture is successfully taken the screen will zoom in on the photo which will showcase the species name, its diet, and its predators. Once this game mode is finished a short quiz will commence in order to make sure that the player remebered important details before proceding to Extuary Expedition.

Estuary Expedition: In this game mode the player will get a chance to control all of the species they took pictures of in the first game, which each species have slightly varing mechanics. For example creatures at the bottom of the food chain will be more focused on avoiding predators while a predator will be more focused on eating as much food as possible.
